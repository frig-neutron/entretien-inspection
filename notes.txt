Firebase
--------

`firebase serve` sets the referer to localhost, which prevents the logged in user image from loading. Apparently it's a google thing - aliasing 127.0.0.1 to ultra.klaus and permitting this domain under https://console.firebase.google.com/project/friendlychat-58fd4/authentication/providers worked.


Setup
=====

Create new firebase project.

Import resource into terraform

Terraform
---------
Before using terraform 

    gcloud auth application-default

Workspaces
 - dev
 - stg (not yet)
 - prd (net yet)



Google Billing Budget
---------------------
- set up manually b/c the api requires a Service Account and not a personal account (which is too much for me)

TODO: 
 - bring budget under control w/ SA impersonation
