Firebase
--------

`firebase serve` sets the referer to localhost, which prevents the logged in user image from loading. Apparently it's a google thing - aliasing 127.0.0.1 to ultra.klaus and permitting this domain under https://console.firebase.google.com/project/friendlychat-58fd4/authentication/providers worked.

Create new firebase project.

Import resource into terraform

Terraform
